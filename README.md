# Data-Capture

The goal of this project is to accurately estimate the number of people in any given
environment. This will enable institutes, such as Arkansas State University, to effectively
determine how to enforce safe social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by
being provided with the number of people in one area at any time; this is done by using
ThingSpeak, an API used to store and retrieve data. ThingSpeak will display the latest
number of people and line chart of all the people counted by the Pi camera. This data
will enable institutes to decide where and when social distancing rules should be
enforced more strictly or loosely based on the traffic in the area.
